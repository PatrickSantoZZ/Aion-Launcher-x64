Aion-Launcher-x64
=================

Launch Aion in 64 Bit with Aion shop working ingame

This is a little exe to start Aion from the gameforge directory in 64 Bit

the limitation is that the game must be installed to the default install dir

C:\Program Files (x86)\GameforgeLive\Games\GBR_eng\AION\Download\bin64\aion.bin

If you want to just download the program you can from 
http://www.actualmanx.com/aion-gameforge-launcher-x64-64-bit-fix/

The first download 
Will launch the 64 bit game and have the aion shop open in a browser (webshop).

The Second download 
Will launch the 64 bit game and have the aion shop ingame same as launching from the gameforge launcher.

TODO...
chosose folder where Aion is installed as steam got popular
